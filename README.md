# GuideToLandingFirstProgrammingJob

Everyone has a different background, education, and experience. What worked for one person should not be taken as the exact set of activities required to land a job but as a subset of those tasks.

I'm breaking this guide out into different sections. There's no specific order here.

# Who this guide is for
This will be useful for you only if you have a good mastery of the core competencies needed for a programming job. I'll list them here, but this isn't an exhaustive list, and some jobs will require more or less of them.

topic - What: Why
Algorithms know how to prove time/space complexity: You won't ever directly use these skills on the job. No one is likely to ask you to write a sophisticated algorithm from scratch, but if you have this knowledge, you're less likely to design systems poorly; for example, if your product runs on the edge vs. in the cloud, real-time processing, etc.

Mastery in a specific language you want to work in. Ideally, you have something from this list:
Python: good for data science and prototyping
Java/C++: depends on the stack: much backend is written in this
Javascript AND a recent version of a popular FE framework: critical for working on UI/UX
